/**
 * You are given a positive integer n.

A positive integer is a base-10 component if it is the product of a single digit from 1 to 9 and a non-negative power of 10. For example, 500, 30, and 7 are base-10 components, while 537, 102, and 11 are not.

Express n as a sum of only base-10 components, using the fewest base-10 components possible.

Return an array containing these base-10 components in descending order.
